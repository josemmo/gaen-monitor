## What is this?
GAEN Monitor is an extremely simple app for detecting GAEN (Google-Apple Exposure Notification) advertisement packets.
These messages are broadcast by mobile devices running COVID-19 contact tracing apps.

Instead of showing a list of messages as other apps already do, GAEN Monitor displays a radar-like UI that approximates the distance of emitting devices in relation to where you are.

## Installation
Download the latest release APK from [this repository](https://github.com/josemmo/gaen-monitor/releases/latest) and install it on an Android 6.0+ device.

To compile the app yourself, get the source code and use Gradle to build the project (requires Java 8+).
